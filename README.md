# Powrush Open Engine

Open-source core engine for **Powrush Single-Player** – a post-apocalyptic space-thriving horde survival game with low-gravity arenas, action-RPG progression, and P2ENL (Play-to-Earn-and-Learn) elements grounded in realistic multiplanetary vision.

Inspired by Conquest Dark, Halls of Torment, and Diablo-style loops—with a Powrush twist: Fight Draek hordes, nurture kingdoms, thrive eternally.

## Hybrid Model
- **Open (MIT License)**: Core systems, blueprints, mechanics—fork/mod/contribute to accelerate single-player (and future Web2 MMO/NYK Web3).
- **Closed**: Proprietary assets (3D models/animations like Cydruid Archer/Human Warrior/Cydruid Mage, UI/loot icons/loading screens, licensed music/Fab templates, levels/lore)—official builds only.

## Key Open Features
- Low-gravity physics & horde waves
- Fast upgrade choices (Balatro-inspired)
- Modular character framework (placeholders for Humans, Cydruids, Quellorians, Draeks, Ambrosians)
- Hooks for APAAGI Councils (ethical decision systems—odd-number veto, mercy pruning)
- ESAO-inspired self-healing placeholders (e.g., radiation recovery, positive morale bloom)

## Setup
1. Clone:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AutonomicityGames/Powrush-OpenEngine.git
